# TheShadowBrokersLeak

Include Equation Group Leak And 2017-9 Leak

## Equation Group Leak

Archive of leaked [Equation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_Group) materials, released by a group calling themselves "Shadow Brokers" - they are seeking to sell additional material, which is a violation of Github terms, and led to the Github repository they created being disabled. As such, none of the communication from the leaking group is hosted here, and will not be included.

Per [an article](https://motherboard.vice.com/read/why-github-removed-links-to-alleged-nsa-data) that quotes Kate Guarente, a Github employee:

  "Per our Terms of Service (section A8), we do not allow the auction or sale of stolen property on GitHub. As such, we have removed the repository in question"

This is the reason that the only material posted here is the contents of the archive, not their requests for money for additional material.
